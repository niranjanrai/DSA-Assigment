/**
 ** Q.1 Explain Middlewares in NodeJS ? **
In Node.js, middlewares are functions or sets of functions that sit between the incoming request and the outgoing response in an application's request-response cycle. They provide a way to add additional functionality, modify the request or response objects, or perform tasks such as error handling, authentication, logging, and more.

Middleware functions are executed in a sequential manner, and each middleware has access to the request and response objects as well as the `next` function. The `next` function is used to pass control to the next middleware in the chain. It allows multiple middlewares to be chained together, with each middleware performing its specific tasks and then passing control to the next middleware.

Middleware functions can be used in various parts of a Node.js application, such as routing, error handling, authentication, logging, and more. Here are a few examples:

1. Routing Middleware: Middleware functions can be used to handle routes and perform tasks such as parsing request bodies, validating inputs, or handling route-specific operations.

2. Error Handling Middleware: Middleware functions can be used to handle errors in the application. They can catch and handle errors that occur during request processing, providing a centralized error handling mechanism.

3. Authentication Middleware: Middleware functions can be used for authentication and authorization purposes. They can validate user credentials, check access permissions, and enforce authentication rules for specific routes or parts of the application.

4. Logging Middleware: Middleware functions can be used for logging request details, application metrics, or other relevant information. They can intercept requests, log the necessary data, and then pass control to the next middleware or request handler.

5. Static File Serving Middleware: Middleware functions can be used to serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or images. They can intercept requests for static files, read the file from the server, and send it back as a response to the client.

Middleware functions provide a flexible and modular approach to add functionality and modify request/response objects in a Node.js application. They allow for code reuse, separation of concerns, and can significantly enhance the development and maintenance of web applications.

**Q.2 Why use Express Over NodeJS ? ** 

Express is a web application framework for Node.js, which means it is built on top of Node.js and provides additional features and abstractions to simplify web development. Here are some reasons why you might choose to use Express over plain Node.js:

 ** Q.3 What are REST API ? **

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints and principles for designing networked applications. REST APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a way of implementing the principles of REST for creating web services that can be consumed by client applications.

Here are some key characteristics and concepts of REST APIs:

1. Resource-Based: REST APIs are built around resources, which are entities or objects that can be identified by a unique identifier (URI). Resources can represent entities such as users, products, or any other meaningful data in the application.

2. Stateless: REST is stateless, meaning that each request from a client to a server should contain all the necessary information to understand and process the request. The server does not maintain any client-specific context between requests. Each request is independent and self-contained.

3. CRUD Operations: REST APIs typically support the four basic CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are mapped to the HTTP methods: POST (Create), GET (Read), PUT/PATCH (Update), and DELETE (Delete). By using these HTTP methods, you can perform actions on the resources.

4. Uniform Interface: REST APIs follow a uniform interface, which means they have a consistent and predictable way of accessing and manipulating resources. This includes using standard HTTP methods, using resource identifiers (URIs) to address resources, and using HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of a request.

5. Representation of Resources: Resources in a REST API are represented using different media types, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language). Clients and servers communicate by exchanging representations of resources. JSON is the most commonly used format for REST APIs due to its simplicity and readability.

6. Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): HATEOAS is a principle in REST that suggests including hyperlinks in the response payload to allow clients to navigate the API and discover available actions dynamically. By including hyperlinks, the API becomes self-descriptive, and clients can follow these links to perform further actions.

REST APIs have become widely adopted for building web services due to their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with various platforms and technologies. They provide a standardized way for different applications to communicate and interact with each other over HTTP.

** Q.4 What is the use of MongoDB? **
