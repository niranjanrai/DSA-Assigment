ðŸ’¡ **Question 6**

Given two strings s and goal, return true *if and only if* s *can become* goal *after some number of **shifts** on* s.

A **shift** on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

- For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"

**Output:**

true




*/
const rotateString = (s, goal) => {
  if (s.length !== goal.length) {
    return false; // If the lengths are different, s cannot become goal
  }

  const concatenated = s + s; // Concatenate s with itself

  return concatenated.includes(goal); // Check if goal is a substring of concatenated
};

// Example usage:
const s = "abcde";
const goal = "cdeab";
console.log(rotateString(s, goal)); // Output: true
